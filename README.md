# 332_omts
omts database project for CMPE 332 at Queen's University

To run this code using XAMPP local host

1. Find the XAMPP installation folder on your computer
    For me, this folder is under D:\ProgramFiles\XAMPP\

2. Locate the folder "htdocs" in the XAMPP installation folder
    D:\ProgramFiles\XAMPP\htdocs
    
3. You can either copy and paste code from the repository directly into the htdocs folder,
    or you can create a new folder, D:\ProgramFiles\XAMPP\htdocs\332_omts, and add the
    necessary files to that
    
4. I have a folder in "htdocs" called "332_omts" and to run the code through XAMPP,
    I have to go to my browser and type "http://localhost/332_omts/index.html" in the address
    line.
    
5. This should work if you have the files from the repository in the correct places in your
    file system
